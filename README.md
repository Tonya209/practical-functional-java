# Practical Functional Java
Examples and exercises for the "Practical Functional Java" workshop.

See [https://jeffgbutler.github.io/practical-functional-java/](https://jeffgbutler.github.io/practical-functional-java/) for detailed instructions. 

## Exercises
For all exercises, the basic instructions are "make the tests pass". This may involve uncommenting some failing tests. There are TODO comments in most classes in the "exercises.*" packages with instructions on what to do. See the links above for detailed descriptions of the exercises.
